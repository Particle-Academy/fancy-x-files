## [Unreleased]

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING — PHP 8.2 is no longer supported.** `require.php` moves from `^8.2` to `^8.4`.

  **What you must do:** on PHP 8.4 or newer, nothing. On 8.2, either upgrade PHP first or stay on the previous release — it keeps working and is unaffected by this.

- CI now tests PHP 8.4 only, instead of a matrix spanning versions this package no longer claims to support. A matrix that tests what the manifest forbids is worse than none — it reports green for a combination nobody can install.

### Why

These are the kit 0.5 platform floors. The suite was split across PHP 8.2 and 8.3 with the framework spanning 11–13, so no package could rely on anything newer than its weakest sibling. Every PHP package in the kit takes the same floors at once, so a consumer never has to resolve a mix.

Pre-1.0, so this lands in a MINOR. **No API changed, nothing was removed, nothing was renamed** — only what the package requires.


## 0.1.1 — 2026-06-17

- **laravel:** make well-known routes cacheable for route:cache deploy

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-17
